			ULTRASHAPE
		</h2>
		<p>
			Ultrashape is a puzzle game, loosely based on the poem from Eli Clare’s Making Our Bodies Home. It features three main levels, each with a different mechanic needed in order to solve it. The game is played on a 3D installation with a smartphone.<br><br>
			The main goal with the game was to create and implement game mechanics that cannot be done in any other medium. My interest was in how the user’s body and pose can interact and manipulate the virtual scene. The game shows a heavy focus on the user’s proximity, location, rotation, and view frustum.
